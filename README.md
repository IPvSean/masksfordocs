# Volunteers Fighting COVID-19 in the Triangle, NC

Face shields and PPE that protect doctors and nurses from COVID-19 airborne splatter are in short supply.

We are 3D-printing face shields to provide healthcare professionals with the protective gear that they need to stay safe!

# Background

As hospitals and front line workers run out of **PPE** (personal protective gear), people around the world are creating solutions to save lives.

We are a bunch of nerdy engineers in the Raleigh - Durham - Chapel Hill metro area collectivley known as "the triangle", and we are 3D printing face shields to help protect workers from airborne splatter.  

I highly recommend it if you are unfamiliar with 3D printers, face shields, and what we are trying to do to check out this YouTube video: https://youtu.be/sbEj7M3aZIg  I promise it is worth the watch.
