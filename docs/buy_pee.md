# Purchasing PPE

We are trying to curate a list of local manufactures and suppliers that are now able to supply PPE (personal protective equipment) in North Carolina.

# High Quantity

I have already talked to two NC manufactures that can produce various PPE.  The only drawback here is they are used to selling larger increments.  We do not want to overwhelm them with small orders or they will not be able to fulfill them.

## Gilero

Gilero is producing face shields.  They are based in Pittsboro, NC (Chatham County)

![gilero shield](../images/gilero_shield.jpg)

- price per unit: ~$5.30
- minimum order size: 250 units ($5.30 * 250 = $1325)

We can do introductions to Gilero's sales director if you are able to purchase larger quantities, or you can work with us and we can do a group buy option.
