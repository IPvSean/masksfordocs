# Low Quantity

## BlueHillsCo

They are also able to do large quantities as well (1000+), but it is more rare to do small quantities so I am listing them here first!

# Bright View Technologies

Website:[https://www.brightviewtechnologies.com/](https://www.brightviewtechnologies.com/products/bright-shield/bright-shield/page.aspx?id=1552)
Bright View Technologies is producing face shields. They are based in Durham, North Carolina.

![brightview.jpg](../images/brightview.jpg)

I am putting this under low quantity because they can sell units of 10 via Amazon but they would prefer to sell in increments of 250.  Please put them in contact with your local supplier so that they can do larger orders and drive costs down for everyone.  They can do huge orders as well, so they can produce thousands of shields.

Two ways to order:
- Amazon (higher price per unit): [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087N14Q48/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_TQaVEb9BF6G2H), price per unit is 7.95 for a 10 pack
- Direct [https://www.brightviewtechnologies.com/contact/contact-us/contact-us-form~form.aspx](https://www.brightviewtechnologies.com/contact/contact-us/contact-us-form~form.aspx) fill out the form and put in the comments what you are looking to purchase.
  - 50 units at 3.95 per shield ($197.5)
  - 250 units at 3.75 per shield ($937.5)
  - larger quantities contact them

# High Quantity

I have already talked to two NC manufactures that can produce various PPE.  The only drawback here is they are used to selling larger increments.  We do not want to overwhelm them with small orders or they will not be able to fulfill them.

## Gilero

Website: [https://www.gilero.com/](https://www.gilero.com/)
Gilero is producing face shields.  They have a plant in Pittsboro, NC (Chatham County)

![gilero shield](../images/gilero_shield.jpg)

- price per unit: ~$5.30
- minimum order size: 250 units ($5.30 * 250 = $1325)

We can do introductions to Gilero's sales director if you are able to purchase larger quantities, or you can work with us and we can do a group buy option.

I have higher resolution pictures and measurements here: [https://photos.app.goo.gl/SkdmUNiFdrVYxmfP9](https://photos.app.goo.gl/SkdmUNiFdrVYxmfP9)

## Sharpeco

Website: [https://sharpeco.net/](https://sharpeco.net/)

![sharpeco shield](../images/sharpeco2.jpeg)

Based in Winston Salem, NC they can create and distribute the following PPE:

- cotton masks $3.50 per mask
- face shields $3.50 per shield
- disposable mask (waiting room mask) ~$1 a piece
- acrylic sheeting for waiting rooms (e.g. like a large sneeze guard)

They are used to doing shipment of 1000 units at a time but will work with smaller orders as they come.

So that would be $3500 for 1000 face shields.  Again we can do a group buy, but if you are a larger practice this is a great option.
