# Fund us!

Right now we are working on conjunction with [https://masksfordocs.com/](https://masksfordocs.com/).  This group did not exist in February and now has thousands of people joining and contributing.  Non-profit status and a structured organization is still happening and being worked on by many volunteers across the country.  This means it will be sometime before we can get funds to pay for filament or other parts we need now.  We have been encouraged just to work within our local community.

Many volunteers are using their own money, time and energy to help our local community in the Triangle area of North Carolina.  I am currently tracking this manually in Google Sheets with several other volunteers.  Luckily filament is fairly inexpensive!

This Triangle area website and group are **not** a registered non-profit and I cannot provide receipts.  Your two options to help us financially are:

- Donate directly to my already setup PayPal and VenMo accounts and directly distribute fund

   - [Paypal](paypal.me/seancav)
   - [Venmo](www.venmo.com/Seanx2386)

- Buy filament and deliver and email me [sean.cavanaugh@masksfordocs.com](sean.cavanaugh@masksfordocs.com).  I can coordinate with where it needs to go.

# More information

As you can see by one of the volunteers Alex Kretzschmar's blog [https://blog.ktz.me/3d-printed-covid-19-face-shields/](https://blog.ktz.me/3d-printed-covid-19-face-shields/) we can produce face shields for under a dollar each.  That means if you donated $5 you are potentially creating 5 face shields!

I will divide up money to volunteers that provide me a receipt for their filament orders.  Many volunteers are not asking for any money at all because their own friends and family have already funded them!  Any additional money that we have over and beyond the cost of filament will be donated to local area non-profits after we beat COVID-19.  If you have an idea for a non-profit email me above.
