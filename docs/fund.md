# Fund us!

Fund Protective Gear! Right now we are working on conjunction with [https://masksfordocs.com/](https://masksfordocs.com/).  This group did not exist in February and now has thousands of people joining and contributing.  Non-profit status and a structured organization is still happening and being worked on by many volunteers across the country.  

Please donate to [https://masksfordocs.com/donate](https://masksfordocs.com/donate)

# More information

As you can see by one of the volunteers Alex Kretzschmar's blog [https://blog.ktz.me/3d-printed-covid-19-face-shields/](https://blog.ktz.me/3d-printed-covid-19-face-shields/) we can produce face shields for under a dollar each.  That means if you donated $5 you are potentially creating 5 face shields!
