# Print Face Shields

Right now we are concentrating on face shields since we do not have the capability to make N95 masks with 3D printers.

Specifically our group is currently concentrating on printing the 3DVerkstan North America 6-hole design.  I am working with some folks in Durham that can make the transparent shield to attach to this visor.
