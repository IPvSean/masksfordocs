# Print Face Shields

**UPDATE MAY 8TH 2020** Stop frame production temporarily. We have more frames than we have transparent shields.  We need help with assembly.  If you can volunteer time we need people between 930 M-F at our location in Durham, NC.  You can contact me at [sean.cavanaugh@masksfordocs.com](mailto:sean.cavanaugh@masksfordocs.com) or join us on slack.  We also need money, please donate to the [US-NC-Triangle group here](https://local.masksfordocs.com/us-nc-triangle).

Right now we are concentrating on face shields since we do not have the capability to make N95 masks with 3D printers.

Specifically our group is currently concentrating on printing the 3DVerkstan North America 6-hole design.  I am working with some folks in Durham that can make the transparent shield to attach to this visor.
